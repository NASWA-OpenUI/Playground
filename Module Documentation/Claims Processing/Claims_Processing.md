# CLAIMS PROCESSING MODULE

## Purpose & Scope
The Claims Processing Module manages the core business logic for evaluating UI claims, determining eligibility, calculating benefits, and authorizing payments. It serves as the central processing engine for unemployment insurance claims throughout their lifecycle.

## Core Functions
- Initial claim intake and validation
- Monetary determination calculation and management
- Non-monetary issue identification and adjudication
- Benefit calculation and payment authorization
- Overpayment detection and management
- Special program determination (Extended Benefits, Disaster Unemployment, etc.)
- Claim status management
- Claim history tracking

## Data Entities
- Claim
- Monetary Determination
- Non-monetary Determination
- Payment Authorization
- Overpayment
- Issue/Adjudication
- Program Type
- Claim History

## Inputs
- Claimant demographic and identity information
- Claimant work history and separation details
- Employer wage records by quarter
- Employer responses to claim notices
- Weekly certification data
- Previous claim history
- External verification data (identity, employment, etc.)

## Outputs
- Monetary determinations (eligibility, weekly amount, maximum benefit)
- Non-monetary determinations (decisions on issues)
- Payment authorizations
- Overpayment determinations
- Claim status updates
- Notices (to claimants and employers)
- Appeals data
- Federal and state reporting data

## Dependencies
- Claimant Services Module: Receives application data and sends determinations
- Employer Services Module: Receives employer responses and wage information
- Benefits Administration Module: Sends payment authorizations
- Appeals Module: Sends appeals data and receives appeal decisions
- Tax Administration Module: Receives wage record data
- Reporting Module: Sends reporting data

## Integration Requirements
- Exposes REST APIs for all core functions
- Consumes events from the Integration Platform event bus
- Publishes state change events to the event bus
- Leverages the Business Rules Engine for state-specific determination logic
- Implements standard data models for all entities
- Provides webhooks for real-time notifications

## User Personas
- Claims Examiners
- Adjudicators
- UI Program Specialists
- System Administrators
- Indirect: Claimants and Employers (via their respective service modules)

## Compliance Requirements
- DOL UI Requirements (ETA Handbooks 301, 384, 391, 395, 399, 402)
- State-specific UI laws and regulations
- Federal reporting requirements (ETA 207, 218, 227)
- Data retention policies
- Privacy and security requirements (PII/PHI)

## Success Metrics
- Accuracy of monetary and non-monetary determinations
- Timeliness of determinations (first payment time lapse)
- Compliance with federal performance metrics
- Processing capacity (claims per hour)
- Error rates
- System availability and response time
