# INTEGRATION PLATFORM

## Purpose & Scope
The Integration Platform provides the foundational infrastructure that enables all UI modules to operate together as a cohesive system. It manages communication between modules, enforces standards, handles cross-cutting concerns, and provides core services that support the entire ecosystem.

## Core Functions
- API management and gateway services
- Business rules engine
- Event bus/message broker
- Data transformation services
- Identity and access management
- Workflow orchestration
- Logging and monitoring
- Configuration management
- Integration adapters for external systems
- Master data management

## Data Entities
- API Definition
- Business Rule
- Event/Message
- Workflow Definition
- User/Role
- System Configuration
- Integration Adapter
- Log Entry
- Master Data Entity

## Inputs
- API calls from all modules
- Events from all modules
- Business rules from administrators
- Configuration settings
- Authentication requests
- Integration requests
- State-specific customizations

## Outputs
- API responses
- Routed messages/events
- Authentication tokens
- Business rule evaluations
- Workflow states
- Monitoring data
- Integration responses
- Configuration settings

## Dependencies
- All functional modules: Provides core services to all
- External systems: Facilitates integration

## Integration Requirements
- Implements standard API protocols (REST, GraphQL)
- Supports multiple message formats (JSON, XML)
- Provides service discovery mechanisms
- Implements robust security standards
- Supports high availability and fault tolerance
- Enables versioning of APIs and services

## User Personas
- System administrators
- Integration specialists
- Business analysts (rule configuration)
- Security administrators
- Operations staff
- Developers

## Compliance Requirements
- Security standards (NIST)
- Identity standards (OAuth, SAML)
- Availability requirements
- Disaster recovery standards
- Audit logging requirements
- Performance standards

## Success Metrics
- System uptime/availability
- API response times
- Message throughput
- Integration onboarding time
- Rule execution performance
- Cross-module transaction completion rates
- Error rates in integrations
- Security incident metrics
